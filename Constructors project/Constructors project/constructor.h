//     NOTES TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT DEFAULT and COPY CONSTRUCTORS and DESTRUCTORS:
//     1. defailt constructor can be referenced by other constructor types to clean up and simplify code
//     2. default constructor declaration lines should contain defaulting values in its argument brackets.
//     3. destructor is mainly important when using pointers, networking processes and file management or data allocation
//     4. Any function that makes use of source variables such as the get_info seen above, will need a copy made which is why we made the copy constructor
//     5. copy constructor arguments should be constant since we don't want to alter the source data , and should be a reference to the source as we need a copy of it.
